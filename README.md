[`swim`](https://gitlab.com/spade-lang/swim) subcommand inspired by the amazing
[`cargo-clean-all`](https://github.com/dnlmlr/cargo-clean-all) for Rust
(although they probably have a better implementation than the hacky code I
wrote!).

You can even set a config file to, for example, automatically skip certain
directories.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

Make sure you have [`swim`](https://gitlab.com/spade-lang/swim) installed.
That's it!

## üì¶ Install

Install from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/swim-clean-all):

```
cargo install swim-clean-all
```

(Sorry, no `cargo binstall` magic yet.)

## ‚ú® Usage

```
$ swim clean-all --help
Usage: swim-clean-all [<search_root>] [--skip <skip...>] [--max-depth <max-depth>] [--config <config>] [--ignore-config] [--verbose]

Recursively clean all swim projects in a given directory that match the specified criteria

Positional Arguments:
  search_root       the root directory to recursively search for swim projects;
                    defaults to the cwd

Options:
  --skip            directories to skip when traversing
  --max-depth       maximum depth search limit; defaults to 100
  --config          manually specify a config path, e.g., foo.toml
  --ignore-config   do not load and extend the config file
  --verbose         print debugging information
  --help, help      display usage information
```

Note that cleaning a project will erase the entire build folder instead of
calling `swim clean` -- I will add support for this customization if requested.

### Config File

This subcommand searches for a file named `swim-clean-all.toml`:

1. under the directory given in the environment variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, if
   specified;
2. under the standard location for each operating system (the following table is
   reproduced from [this documentation](https://docs.rs/dirs/6.0.0/dirs/fn.config_local_dir.html) for a user named "Alice");
    |Platform|Value|Example|
    |--------|-----|-------|
    |Linux|`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME`/.config|/home/alice/.config|
    |macOS|`$HOME`/Library/Application Support|/Users/Alice/Library/Application Support|
    |Windows|`{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}`|C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Local|
3. as a last resort, under `~/.config`

Refer to the definition of `struct Config` in the source code:

```toml
# swim-clean-all.toml
# these are NOT the defaults
skip = ["~/Library"]
max-depth = 50
```
